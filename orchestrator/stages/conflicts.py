"""Resolving-conflict stage handler and its merge-loop primitives.

Owns `_handle_resolving_conflict` plus the conflict-loop-private helpers:
the shared post-agent disposition funnel (`_post_conflict_resolution_result`)
and the `conflict_round` audit-event emitter
(`_emit_conflict_round_incremented`).

ALL workflow-owned helpers (`_park_awaiting_human`, `_now_iso`, the
worktree plumbing, the drift / messaging helpers re-exported into
`workflow`, the validating-side `_post_user_content_change_result`, the
implementing-side `_resume_dev_with_text` / `_on_question` /
`_on_dirty_worktree`) are reached through the parent module via
`from .. import workflow as _wf` at call time. The compatibility surface
tests rely on -- `patch.object(workflow, "_foo")` -- has to keep working
from inside the stage module too, so the handler must NOT direct-import
these names from `workflow_drift` / `workflow_messages` / `worktrees`;
doing so would bind a stable reference that test patches against
`workflow.X` could not affect.
